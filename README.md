You can go to the above website with the above link and check it out.
I have trained the model using Random Forest Regressor through which i have been able to achieve 94% accuracy.
Then i have saved the model using pickle.
I have used Flask framework to deploy the model through Render.
I have also performed analysis on this with jupyter notebook where i have used different ML algorithms.

My experience with css or styling is literally non-existant its just something i am not interested in, not hating I just created the outer template like the inputs and the buttons.
So the styling of the HTML page goes to my friend Debjeet Das his Github handle is : https://github.com/dasdebjeet .
